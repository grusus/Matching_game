To be honest, I didn't know IDE(Visual studio) or C# till last wednesday. Last time I programmed myself was 14 years ago and it was Pascal and C. 
During last 10 years I was just only customizing someone else's open source code for my purposes like for Arduino for 3d printer or for M5stick-c for tally light for my cameramen for live streams. 
I want to learn programming again, because that is what I always wanted to do. But life is life. For past 14 years I was somewhere else. 
I know my code is very simple, more like Pascal'ish, and abolutelly not object oriented, but for now I don't know how to optimize it. 
I have idea but don't know how to code it. There were no much time to learn it. 
Hope to hear from you soon. 
Have a great day!
